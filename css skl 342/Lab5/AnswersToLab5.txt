1.2 The program won't compile because of overflow

1.3 Floats are accurate to 6 places, doubles to 15. Doubles should be used when more precision is needed, and floats are probably faster being smaller.

4.5 The code compiles and runs, but prints out the original key and value from pokemap and then 0. Not sure what is going on.
