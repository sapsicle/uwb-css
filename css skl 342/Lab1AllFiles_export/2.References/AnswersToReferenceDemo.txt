2. file does in fact compile

3. onePlus() increments a by 1, though a is passed by value making a copy,
and with no return value the original a stays unchanged

4. the a in main is changed as the reference to the original a is passed,
and no copy is made like in onePlus()

6. value receives a constant string reference to the string s,
which passes its reference without a copy but does not allow it to be mutated,
using less memory by not copying and preventing unwanted mutation

7. value returns a reference to an int which means the int stays in memory and is not copied when returned
++ increments the int by 1
